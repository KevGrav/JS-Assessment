This project is set out to make a vending machine using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The vending machine will have 12 different snack options.
First we will need to load our 12 snacks using the vending options. Each should have a corresponding image that will display in one of the vending boxes.
The screen will display "Make a selection".
Use the keyboard to select the desired snack reference code. The buttons are interactive, as they are pressed their values are displayed on the screen.
The snack will be dispensed into the drawer.
